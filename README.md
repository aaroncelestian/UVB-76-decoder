# üîä UVB-76 Live Stream Decoder

A real-time frequency analysis and FSK decoding application for the mysterious UVB-76 "Buzzer" radio station. This application streams live audio from internet radio sources, analyzes frequency patterns, and attempts to decode binary data from the station's FSK (Frequency Shift Keying) transmissions.

## üì° About UVB-76

UVB-76, also known as "The Buzzer," is a shortwave radio station that broadcasts on 4625 kHz. It has been transmitting a monotonous buzzing sound since the 1970s, occasionally interrupted by voice messages in Russian. This application focuses on analyzing the low-frequency modulation patterns that may carry encoded data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No Audio Data**
- Verify internet connection
- Try different stream URLs
- Check if stream is currently active
- Some streams may require specific audio codecs

**No Binary Data in Decoded Tab**
- UVB-76 may be in carrier-only mode (normal)
- Data transmissions are rare and brief
- Ensure stream is actually UVB-76 frequency
- Check console for FSK state detection messages

**Plot Update Issues**
- Reduce plot update frequency if performance is poor
- Close other resource-intensive applications
- Try smaller window sizes for lower-end systems

### Stream Sources
If preset URLs don't work, search for:
- "UVB-76 live stream"
- "4625 kHz WebSDR"
- "Buzzer station online"
- KiwiSDR stations tuned to 4.625 MHz

## üéØ Understanding UVB-76 Behavior

### Normal Operation
- **95% of time**: Constant 32.30 Hz buzzer tone
- **Rare events**: Brief FSK modulation during message transmission
- **Very rare events**: Voice announcements in Russian

### What to Expect
- Long periods of no binary data (normal buzzer operation)
- Occasional bursts of 0s and 1s during active transmission
- Most "data" may be synchronization or test patterns
- Actual message content is extremely rare
